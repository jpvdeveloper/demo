        <p class="styling"> My name is Pruthviraj Jadhav, and I am a software engineer at Amazon. This website, named
            Wheather Forecast Application, allows you to check the weather for specific locations and predict upcoming
            weather conditions. It plays a crucial role in helping farmers prepare for adverse weather, potentially
            saving their crops and livelihoods.
